This directory contain test files for high level testing.

Currently you should run:

- make_env.sh (will compile postgres and create a cluster)
- pg_ctl.sh start (will start the test cluster on port 15432)
- test_WHAT.sh (will install, test, uninstall the extension WHAT)
- pg_ctl.sh stop (guess what)
